# 🛒 Retail Sales Analysis Project

This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover trends, evaluate performance metrics, and identify the best-selling products and time periods.

The goal is to help businesses make informed decisions using sales insights like:
- Best-selling months by year
- Sales trends over time
- Category-wise performance


- Cleaned and preprocessed messy retail data
- Analyzed monthly average sales
- Identified top-selling months per year
- Detected null values and handled missing data
- Performed date extraction and transformation
- Visualized sales by category and region


- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)
- SQL (for querying structured data)


The dataset includes sales transactions with columns like:
- `sale_date`
- `category`
- `price_per_unit`
- `quantity`
- `total_sale`
- `cogs` (Cost of Goods Sold)
